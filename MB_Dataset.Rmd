As you would expect, there is a positive linear relationship between at bats and RBI's. Similiar results with the other variables in this data set as well. 
```{r}
# Add jitter feature to spread out points
ggplot(data = Batting_df, mapping = aes(x = AB, y = RBI)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_jitter() 
```

Interesting chart that shows how many games most players play.
```{r}
# Basic barplot in ggplot
ggplot(data = Batting_df) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=HR), color='blue')
```



```{r}
# Use of statistical transformation in this code
# Not helpful here, but could have future use
ggplot(data = Batting_df) +
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = AB, y = RBI),
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
  )
```

```{r}
# Color a bar chart using fill
ggplot(data= Batting_df) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=class, y = )) +
  coord_flip() # Used to flip the coordinate
